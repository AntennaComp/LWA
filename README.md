In this repository you find the CAD data of the Leaky Wave Antenna originally by Georgiy Solomakha and his team seperated in substrate and conductors.

Publication: Solomakha, Georgiy; Svejda, Jan; Rennings, Andreas; Erni, Daniel (2020): A new RF coil for UHF MRI based on a slotted microstrip line. In: Journal of Physics Conference Series 1461, p 1-3. DOI: 10.1088/1742-6596/1461/1/012168.

Materials: 

- Conductor: PEC
- Substrate: FR-4(lossy), epsilon=4.3, loss tangent=0.025 at 10GHz (constant fit), thermal conductivity=0.3
- Spacer: epsilon=3.5, loss tangent=0.01 at 250MHz (constant fit)
